DynamicGraphView
================

A simple but effective dynamic GraphView implementation for iPhone SDK for float values.

The left image shows a graph with only positive values and without curved lines. The right graph draws from positve and negative values and has the option for curved lines activated.

Implementing this control into your project is very easy.

##### 1) Copy both GraphView.h and GraphView.m into your projet resources.

##### 2) In your ViewController.h:


    import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    import "GraphView.h"


    @interface ViewController : UIViewController <UITextFieldDelegate> {
    
    GraphView *graphView;
    
    }

    @property (strong, nonatomic) GraphView *graphView;

    @end

##### 3) In your ViewController.m:

    - (void)viewDidLoad 
    {
    graphView = [[GraphView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 10, self.view.frame.size.width-20, 180)];
    [graphView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor yellowColor]];
    [graphView setSpacing:10];
    [graphView setFill:YES];
    [graphView setStrokeColor:[UIColor redColor]];
    [graphView setZeroLineStrokeColor:[UIColor greenColor]];
    [graphView setFillColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
    [graphView setLineWidth:2];
    [graphView setCurvedLines:YES];
    [self.view addSubview:graphView];
    }

Done!

##### To control the graph, use following functions:

1) This will display a graph of float values:

    [graphView setArray:(NSArray)]

2) This will add a point to the graph. You can add as many as you like and even do this dynamically. The graph will update every time a new value has been added:

    [graphView setPoint:(float)]

3) This will reset the graph to all 0 values:

    [graphView resetGraph]

4) This sets the number of values displayed in the graph:

    [graphView setNumberOfPointsInGraph:(int)]

5) This will make the space beneth the graph line fill or not:

    [graphView setFill:(BOOL)]

Thats all!
